# VueJS Playground üêõ

Trying out the VueJS framework that's been gaining traction among JavaScript frameworks.

Each folder contains a small project created with Vue. Simply clone/download repo and load `index.html` into your browser of choice.

## Today I learned
- VueJS proxies data, methods and computed properties to make it easier to access from outside sources
- Instance lifecycle and lifecycle methods:
  1. `new Vue()`
  2. `beforeCreate()`
  3. Initialize data and events
  4. Instance created / `created()`
  5. Compile template
  6. `beforeMount()`
  7. Replace el with compiled template, string templates, bindings, etc
  8. Mounted to DOM
  9. Data changed  `beforeUpdate()`  re-render DOM
  10. `beforedDestroy()`
  11. Destroyed
  12. `destroyed() `
